Firewall-Anomaly-Predictor
Welcome to the Firewall-Anomaly-Predictor repository! This project aims to develop a predictive model for analyzing firewall data to detect anomalies, thereby enhancing cybersecurity measures. The system utilizes Python for machine learning, FastAPI for API development, Angular for the frontend application, and Spring for efficient data management.

Overview
Firewall-Anomaly-Predictor is designed to analyze incoming data from firewalls, predicting whether it represents normal network activity or if there are anomalies that may indicate potential security threats. The combination of machine learning algorithms and a robust API allows for real-time analysis and visualization of firewall data.

Technologies Used
Python: The core of the predictive model is implemented in Python, leveraging popular machine learning libraries for efficient data analysis and anomaly detection.

FastAPI: FastAPI is employed to expose the predictive model as a robust API. This enables seamless communication between the model and the frontend application.

Angular: The frontend of the application is developed using Angular, providing a dynamic and user-friendly interface for interacting with the firewall anomaly predictions.

Spring: Spring is utilized for effective data storage, retrieval, and management. It ensures the smooth handling of testing data, facilitating the training and improvement of the predictive model.
